# DESIGN-OF-DQN-ASSISTED-CONTROLLER-FOR-PHYSICAL-SYSTEM

A Deep Reinforcement Learningâ€“based control system to stabilize and optimize the behavior of a Mass-Spring-Damper system using Deep Q-Networks (DQN).

ðŸ§© Problem Statement
Traditional controllers require accurate system models and tuning. In this project, we explore how an agent can learn to control a second-order mechanical system â€” specifically, a Mass-Spring-Damper â€” using Deep Q-Learning without predefined control laws.

ðŸš€ Objective
Stabilize the mass to its equilibrium position.

Minimize oscillations and settling time.

Learn control policies through interaction, not pre-programmed rules.

ðŸ§  Approach
Model the Mass-Spring-Damper system in a custom OpenAI Gym environment.

Implement a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent to observe system state and take control actions.

Train the agent to apply optimal force at each step to stabilize the system under varying damping and stiffness.

ðŸ“Œ Key Features
Discrete action space: agent applies quantized force values.

Custom reward function to encourage stability and penalize oscillations.

Visualization of position, velocity, reward, and convergence.

Adaptive learning: agent generalizes over multiple physical configurations.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Python

NumPy

OpenAI Gym

PyTorch / Keras (update this based on what you used)

Matplotlib

ðŸ“Š Results
Agent successfully learned to dampen oscillations and stabilize the mass.

Trained policies were robust across varying damping and spring constants.

Performance improved significantly compared to random or fixed-action baselines.
